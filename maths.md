### tf.math.exp

exponential:

- tf.math.exp([2])
- e ^ 2 == 7.xxx

### log

usually just used for making graphs smoother, easier to analyze

### logsigma (don't know yet)

## reduce

### reduce_sum

    - just break down and sum all of n
    - if axis = 0, sum each row
    - if axis = 1, sum each column

### reduce_mean

    - just break down and calculate mean all of n
    - if axis = 0, mean for each row
    - if axis = 1, mean for each column

# Symbols

âˆ‘ = sum of

standard deviation:

1. how spread out numbers are

2.

variance a^2:

1. sum of mean / n
2.

# probability

        q (z | x)

- can be state as probability of z event occuring in x condition

# Linear regression

- aka Least square sum

- normally to find line of best fit
